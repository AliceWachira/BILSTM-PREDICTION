# BILSTM-PREDICTION
This code trains the different models, the RNN, LSTM and BI-LSTM and uses the performance evaluation metrics to compare the performance of the models in speed prediction. 
# Data_normalization
This codes normalizes the traffic data for the selected paths and saves the files in a different csv file for further analysis.
# Extraction_of_path_In_NYC_dataset
This codes extracts the traffic information for different paths and saves them separately in a csv file.
# Link_Exploration
This codes explores the distribution of the speed and travel time of different paths during different times of the week.
# NYC traffic data exploration of January, February and March
This code investigates the  speed patterns for three selected months.
